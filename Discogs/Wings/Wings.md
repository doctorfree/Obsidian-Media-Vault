## Artist Profile

This band was a successful endeavour for ex-Beatle Paul McCartney. From its inception in late 1971 the line-up of "Wings" often changed over the years, but retained its core members: 
• Denny Laine (formerly of The Moody Blues) on guitar and vocals
• Linda McCartney on keyboards and vocals
• Paul McCartney on guitar and vocals.
Other members of the band included drummer Denny Seiwell (1971-1973), ex-Spooky Tooth guitarist Henry McCullough (1972-1973), blues guitarist Jimmy McCulloch (1974-1977), drummer Geoff Britton (1974), drummer Joe English (1975-1977), guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holly (both 1978-1979).

Whilst "Wings" was primarily McCartney's band (for a while playing under the moniker "Paul McCartney & Wings"), it was truly a collaborative effort, with all members of the band sharing a hand in songwriting and vocals - with Laine even taking lead vocals from time to time.
