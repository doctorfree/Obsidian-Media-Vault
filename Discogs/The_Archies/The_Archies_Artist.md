## Artist Profile

The Archies is an American fictional garage band founded by Archie Andrews, Reggie Mantle and Jughead Jones. The group first appeared in a 1967 issue of the comic book "Life With Archie." A year later, the concept was transferred to a Saturday morning cartoon series. Original songs were featured in an animated "Archie" TV series which ran on the CBS network from 1968 into the 1970s. A studio group recorded the soundtrack music and had successful releases under the Archies name. Most of the songs are credited to Jeff Barry & Andy Kim ("Barry - Kim "). Other material was written by Ritchie Adams, Mark Barkan, Al Gordon, Bob Levine, Bob Gengo, Gene Allan, Ron Dante, Howard Greenfield and Richard Kim Milford. Jeff Barry produced the music from 1968 - 70, after which Ritchie Adams and Ron Dante took over his role. The animated group members were: Archie Andrews (guitar), Reggie Mantle (bass guitar), Jughead Jones (drums), Betty Cooper (tambourine), Veronica Lodge (keyboards). The real lead singer was Ron Dante, joined in the studio most often by Toni Wine (female duet vocals), Jeff Barry (bass vocals) and Bobby Bloom. Donna Marie replaced Toni Wine in 1970. She in turn was replaced by Merle Miller in 1971. The backing tracks were recorded by session musicians, among them Hugh McCracken, Sal diTroia, Dave Appell and Andy Kim (guitars), Joe Macho and Chuck Rainey (bass), Ron Frangipane and Toni Wine (keyboards), Buddy Saltzman and Gary Chester (drums) and Jeff Barry and Bobby Bloom (percussion). Saxophonist Artie Kaplan contracted the musicians and played baritone sax under the keyboard riff of "Sugar, Sugar", the group's most successful recording. "Sugar, Sugar", became one of the biggest hits of the bubblegum pop genre that flourished from 1968 to 1973. However, a non-charting Archies single, "Love Is Loving In You" is the most coveted release by collectors: Written and sung by Phil Cody and Bob Levine, it features a different group of musicians. The Archies charted seven singles and five albums in North America.
