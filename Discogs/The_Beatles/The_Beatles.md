## Artist Profile

British rock/pop group, formed in Liverpool, England during the late 1950s. Signed a recording contract with EMI in 1962.

The lineup (1962-70) comprised John Lennon (vocals, guitar, harmonica, keyboards), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, percussion), George Harrison (guitar, vocals, sitar), and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals, percussion). In 1961, Stuart Sutcliffe (bass) and Pete Best (drums) were also members.

Following an initial period as a straightforward Mersey-beat group, later recordings saw them experiment with psychedelia, incorporating innovative production techniques involving tape loops and other effects. Despite the group splitting in 1970, their record company has continued to release special products.

Inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 (Group). By 2015, all four members were inducted also as individual solo artists.
