## Artist Profile

American rock band formed in 1969 in Los Angeles, California by brothers Pat Vegas and Lolly Vegas. The brothers were originally from Fresno, CA.

The name Redbone is a joking reference to a Cajun term for a mixed-race person, the band's members being a mixture of Native American and Mexican heritage.

Redbone played primarily rock music with R&B, Cajun, Jazz, tribal, and Latin roots. Their first commercial success came with the single "Maggie" from their second album, Potlatch, in 1970, and two other hit singles followed - "The Witch Queen of New Orleans" (1971, #21 on the Billboard Hot 100) and "Come and Get Your Love" (1974, #5 on the Billboard Hot 100). "Come and Get Your Love", written by Lolly Vasquez stayed in the Billboard chart for 24 weeks, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. on 22 April 1974.

Current members as of 09/03/2014: Pat Vegas: Bass, Vocals, Fernando Verdialez: Guitar, Vocals, Carlos Perez: Guitar, Vocals, Lee Wilson: Drums, Vini Mars: Guitar, Vocals, Harlan Spector: Keyboards, 
Arturo Perez (3) replaced Pete DePoe on the album "Already Here".
