## Artist Profile

Ambrosia is an American rock band, founded in Los Angeles, California in 1971 by schoolmates David Pack (guitar) and Joe Puerta (bass). Later joined by Christopher North (keyboards) and Burleigh Drummond (drums).

The band temporarily split in 1982 due to the poor reception of their fifth album "Road Island", but they got back together in 1989, seven years afterwards.
