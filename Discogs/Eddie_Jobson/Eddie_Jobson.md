## Artist Profile

Born 28 April 1955 Billingham, Cleveland, United Kingdom.

Keyboard player and violinist for a number of UK progressive rock outfits. Replaced Brian Eno in Roxy Music. Founding member of Progressive Rock Super group UK with John Wetton, Allan Holdsworth and Bill Bruford.

There is some confusion as to whether "Zinc" was actually the name of one of Jobson's albums or of the band itself. allmusic.com reviewer Fran√ßois Couture writes: "After his stint with Jethro Tull and as the wave of new romantic pop groups were taking control of the airwaves, Eddie Jobson entered the studio to record his first solo album, known as Zinc, although it was meant to be titled "The Green Album" and billed to the band name "Zinc" -- the record company messed things up quite a bit."
