## Artist Profile

The Flock were an American Rock band from Chicago, formed in 1965 by Rick Canoff and Fred Glickstein.

Originally a Garage Rock band, their sound shifted towards Jazz-Rock / Fusion in the late 60s. After the release of their second album the band split in the early 70s.
A few years later The Flock reformed with a new lineup and went on a European tour in 1973. They released a third studio album in 1975, but split again shortly after.
2014 saw the release of a "lost" studio album comprised of material recorded in the mid to late 70s.
