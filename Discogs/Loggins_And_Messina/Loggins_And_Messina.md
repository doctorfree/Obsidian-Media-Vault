## Artist Profile

Jim Messina was working as an independent record producer for Columbia Records when he met Kenny Loggins, a young singer songwriter, in 1970.
They recorded some of Loggins' songs in Messina's living room and secured him an albums deal with Columbia.
Loggins' debut was to be produced by Messina, whose name would help introduce Loggins to his own established audience.
However, by the record's completion in 1971, such was Messina's contribution that it became a joint release, Kenny Loggins With Jim Messina* - Sittin' In.
The album's success led them to formalise the duo, Loggins & Messina.
Recording a further six studio and two live albums, the pair toured extensively before parting amicably in 1976.
Loggins & Messina began touring together again in 2005.
