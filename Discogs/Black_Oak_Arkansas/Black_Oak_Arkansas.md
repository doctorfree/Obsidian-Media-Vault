## Artist Profile

Black Oak Arkansas is an American Southern rock band named after the band's hometown of Black Oak, Arkansas. The band reached the height of its fame in the 1970s with ten charting albums released in that decade. Their style is punctuated by multiple guitar players and the raspy voice and on-stage antics of vocalist Jim "Dandy" Mangrum.
Following continued diminishing record sales, Jim "Dandy" Mangrum dropped "Arkansas" from the group's name (in an attempt to downplay their Southern-ness).
As "Black Oak" released two albums on Capricorn Records, 'Race with the Devil' in 1977 and 'I'd Rather Be Sailing' in 1978.
