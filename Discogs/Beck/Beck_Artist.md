## Artist Profile

American musician, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. born July 8, 1970, in Los Angeles, California, USA. Son of David Campbell and Bibbe Hansen, grandson of Al Hansen. He was married to Marissa Ribisi from 2004â€“2019.

When his parents split, he and his younger brother stayed with their mother. Beck dropped out of school at the age of 14 and drifted around for about a decade, ending up back in Los Angeles. While playing some open-mike events, he got noticed by the little local label Bong Load Custom Records. In 1993, "Loser" was released to the world in a limited pressing of 500 copies and sent out to radio DJs across the U.S. The song became quite popular, and DGC/Geffen/MCA signed Beck in November of 1993, while giving him the freedom to work with independent labels and to make uncommercial music.
