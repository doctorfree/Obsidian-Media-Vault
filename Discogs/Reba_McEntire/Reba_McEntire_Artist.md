## Artist Profile

Reba McEntire is an American country music artist, born March 28, 1955 in Chockie, Oklahoma, USA. She was discovered by Red Steagall while singing the National Anthem at the National Finals Rodeo in 1974, and signed with Mercury the following year; recording her first tracks & single in 1976. Six albums followed, and after some minor chart success, she scored her first top ten single in 1980 eventually charting number one three years later. She moved to MCA Records in 1984, and was able to gain more control over what material to record, and eventually co-produced some of her albums. She became one of the most prominent artists of this decade, realizing the importance of self promotion and the then new "music video" format. She won CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1986 (and again in 1994) while also being awarded Female Vocalist of the Year or Female Artist countless times into the 2000's (while also achieving several Grammy awards, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2018). During the 1990's, Reba became a major touring act, and also a cultural phenomenon with her multiple multi-platinum selling albums, elaborate stage shows & promotion, which along with Garth Brooks made history and paved the path for countless country music artists to follow. She has also branched into acting, theater, television (the sitcom "Reba" has never left syndication since its debut in 2001), publishing, and most importantly, philanthropy. She is also the sister of recording artists Susie Luchsinger and Pake McEntire. To date, she has sold over 75 million formats worldwide, has had more than 25 number one country chart singles, and continues to be a major presence in pop culture & country music.
