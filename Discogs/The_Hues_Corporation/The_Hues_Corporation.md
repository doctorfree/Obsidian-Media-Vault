# The Hues Corporation

![](../../asssets/artists/The_Hues_Corporation.png)

## Artist Profile

Formed 1969 in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.
Wally Holmes, the man who founded the Hues Corporation, originally had a different name in mind for the trio. "I wanted to call the group the Children Of Howard Hughes, because I knew Hughes was single and he represented a conservative element. I was kind of wild in those days and I thought a fantastic thing would be to take a black group and call them the Children Of Howard Hughes." But Holmes ran into a legal wall and was unable to incorporate Hughes' name into the group. That's when he came up with Hues Corporation.
