## Artist Profile

Spot 1019 was a “little rock combo” hailing from San Francisco, California. The four-piece band specializes in rock tinged with country, blues and punk and had three releases on Frontier Records in the early 1990s, none of which achieved particular popularity. David Dondero proclaims his affection for the band in the song "Michael Raines" on the album "Live at the Hemlock".
