## Artist Profile

Folk / folk rock supergroup compiled of three singer/songwriters, formed circa 1968.

Disappointed with the band structure in various bands they decided to perform under their last names, ensuring their independence. Nonetheless their recordings became popular and they regularly performed as a trio or quartet. When joined by Neil Young they wrote/performed as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.
They first 'disbanded' after their 1970 summer tour, but kept performing in various constructions, on and off, over the years, alongside their solo efforts.

Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1997 (performer).
