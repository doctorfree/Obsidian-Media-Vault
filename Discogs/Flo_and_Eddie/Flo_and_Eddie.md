## Artist Profile

When Mark Volman & Howard Kaylan departed from The Turtles they were embroiled in contract entanglements which prevented them from performing under their own identities. In 1970 the duo hitched up with Frank Zappa as vocalists, touring with his band and being credited on the release Chunga's Revenge by the pseudonym The Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie. The name stuck. They released an eponymous album as The Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie, and the nickname later become shortened to Flo &amp; Eddie.

One highlight of their performances with Zappa was a rendition of The Turtles' "Happy Together" on Fillmore East - June 1971, as a pair of 'Fillmore groupies', though the duo are credited by their given names on the release.
