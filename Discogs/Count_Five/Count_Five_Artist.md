## Artist Profile

US band formed in 1964 in San Jose, California. Their psychedelic-punk hit, Psychotic Reaction, reached the US Top 5 in 1966. They first drew attention by wearing Dracula-style capes to their gigs. After recording one album, also titled Psychotic Reaction, they released a few more singles before disbanding in 1969.
The band's memory was immortalized in a 1972 essay by the famous rock writer Lester Bangs called Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung. In the essay Bangs credited the band for having released several albums - Carburetor Dung, Cartesian Jetstream, Ancient Lace and Wrought-Iron Railings and Snowflakes Falling On the International Dateline: actually, none of these albums has ever existed, except in Bangs' own imagination.
