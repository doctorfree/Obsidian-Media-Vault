## Artist Profile

Paul Horn (born March 17, 1930, New York City, New York, USA - died June 29, 2014, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) was a Grammy Award winning American jazz flautist, saxophonist and composer. In addition to a large discography of jazz recordings, Horn is considered one of the pioneers of new age music. His 1968 album of solo flute and vocals, "Inside" (also known as "Inside the Taj Mahal") has sold over three quarters of a million copies and launched a series of Inside records recorded in natural and sacred sites with unique acoustic properties.

Horn won two Grammy Awards for his 1965 album "Jazz Suite On the Mass Texts". His Grammy nominated albums include "Cycle" (1965), "Traveler" (1987), and "Inside Monument Valley" (1999). Both "Inside" and "Inside II" were top 10 albums on the Billboard jazz chart.

He is the father of Robin Horn.
