## Artist Profile

Not to be confused with The Symphony Orchestra or The London Synphonic Orchestra.
When used fictitiously (by Alfred Scholz or one of his pseudonyms), please use London Symphony Orchestra (2).

The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), founded in 1904, is the oldest of London's symphony orchestras.
The LSO was set up by a group of players who left Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Orchestra because of a new rule requiring players to give the orchestra their exclusive services.
The LSO claims to be the world's most recorded orchestra; it has made gramophone recordings since 1912 and has played on more than 200 soundtrack recordings for the cinema, of which the best known include the 'Star Wars' series. The LSO is consistently ranked as one of the world's leading orchestras.
Since 1982, the LSO has been based in the Barbican Centre in the City of London. 
Frequently mentioned together with London Symphony Chorus.
