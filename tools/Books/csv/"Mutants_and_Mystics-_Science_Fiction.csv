Kripal,"Kripal, Jeffrey J.",,"=""0226453839""","=""9780226453835""",5,4.11,University of Chicago Press,Hardcover,376,2011,2011,,2012/07/28,,,read,"Wow. More than you ever thought possible to know about the relationships and characters involved in the evolution of consciousness from 19th Century mysticism to to origins of superhero comics and sci-fi to the nuclear age and UFO's - aliens, remote viewing, psychics, mystics, artists, Marvel/DC, et al. This book is large and packed. Well researched and easy to read. I would say my only quibble would be the academic tone at times - ok, ok, I get it ... no need to tell me what you are going to tell me then tell me then tell me what you told me.<br/><br/>Great bathroom reader. Definitely deserving of 5 stars.",,,1,0
