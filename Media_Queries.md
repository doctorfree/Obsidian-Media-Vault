# Media Queries

The Obsidian Media Vault markdown contains metadata with tags allowing a variety of Obsidian Dataview queries. For example, the markdown for "Timequake" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has the following YAML prelude:

```yaml
---
bookid: 9594
title: Timequake
author: Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
authors: 
isbn: 0099267543
isbn13: 9780099267546

avgrating: 3.72
publisher: Vintage Classics
binding: Paperback
pages: 219
published: 1997
shelves: science-fiction, novels, vonnegut

---
```

## Dataview

The above book metadata can be used to perform Dataview queries to search, filter, and retrieve books as if they are in a database. For example, to produce a table of all books in this vault by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. published prior to 1970 add the following to a markdown file in the vault:

````markdown
```dataview
TABLE
  title AS "Title",
  author AS "Author",
  published AS "Year"
FROM "Books"
WHERE author = "Kurt Vonnegut Jr." and published < 1970
SORT published ASC
```
````

The above Dataview code block produces the following output:

```dataview
TABLE
  title AS "Title",
  author AS "Author",
  published AS "Year"
FROM "Books"
WHERE author = "Kurt Vonnegut Jr." and published < 1970
SORT published ASC
```
